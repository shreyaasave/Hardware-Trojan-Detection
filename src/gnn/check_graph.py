#Good — 1.82% isolated is small and not a red flag. That confirms the low edge/node 
#ratio isn't from a systematic driver-matching bug; it's just this circuit's actual 
# structure (144 nodes are likely things like unconnected/const-tied intermediate 
# signals or dangling declared-but-unused wires that opt_clean didn't fully strip,
# which is normal). You can move on with confidence — no need to dig further into 
# graph_builder.py.
